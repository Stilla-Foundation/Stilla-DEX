It depends on what kind of configuration you want to set up for the smart contract. Here's an example of a configuration file that sets up some parameters for the smart contract:

```
{
  "tokenName": "MyToken",
  "tokenSymbol": "MTK",
  "initialSupply": 1000000,
  "decimalUnits": 18,
  "exchangeRate": 100,
  "mobileMoneyMerchantID": "Stillapay",
  "mobileMoneyAPI": "narigamba"
}
```

In this example, we have set up the following parameters:

- `tokenName`: The name of the token
- `tokenSymbol`: The symbol of the token
- `initialSupply`: The initial supply of the token
- `decimalUnits`: The number of decimal places the token uses
- `exchangeRate`: The exchange rate between the token and the mobile money currency
- `mobileMoneyMerchantID`: The ID of the mobile money merchant used for the exchange
- `mobileMoneyAPI`: The API used for the mobile money service

These parameters can be used by the deployment script to configure the smart contract accordingly.
