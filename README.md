The project aims to promote financial inclusion in Africa through blockchain-based projects. The project seeks to leverage the unique characteristics of blockchain technology to provide financial services to people who do not have access to traditional banking services. The project proposes several strategies that can be used to achieve this goal, including education and awareness, access to cryptocurrency wallets, partnerships with local merchants, microfinance, and the development of decentralized applications (DApps)
